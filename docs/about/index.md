### Hi, my name is Kevin (Xun) Jin.<br>I'm a network engineer by day :desktop_computer:, $dad^2$ by night :family_man_woman_girl_boy:, and this is my technical blog. Main purpose of this site is to record and share my learning journey. I'm very passionate about tech in general, constantly discovering, building and fixing tech related stuff.
